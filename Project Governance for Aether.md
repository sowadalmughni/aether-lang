# Project Governance for Aether

This document outlines the governance model for the Aether project, defining roles, decision-making processes, and conflict resolution mechanisms.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributor

*   **Definition:** Anyone who has submitted a pull request or opened an issue that has been accepted or actively participated in discussions.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Adhere to the Code of Conduct.
    *   Submit well-documented issues and pull requests.
    *   Participate in discussions and provide constructive feedback.

### Reviewer

*   **Definition:** A Contributor who has demonstrated a deeper understanding of the project, its codebase, and has consistently provided valuable feedback and code reviews.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Review pull requests for quality, correctness, and adherence to project standards.
    *   Provide constructive and timely feedback on contributions.
    *   Help guide new Contributors.
    *   May merge pull requests after approval from at least one other Reviewer or Maintainer.

### Maintainer

*   **Definition:** A Reviewer who has demonstrated significant and sustained contributions to the project, a deep understanding of its vision, and a commitment to its long-term health.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Define and guide the project's vision and roadmap.
    *   Make final decisions on technical direction and major architectural changes.
    *   Manage releases and versioning.
    *   Oversee the overall health and direction of the community.
    *   Resolve conflicts and enforce the Code of Conduct.
    *   Grant and revoke Reviewer and Maintainer status.

## Decision-Making and Release Voting

Decisions are made by consensus among Maintainers. In cases where consensus cannot be reached, a formal voting process will be initiated.

*   **Minor Decisions (e.g., bug fixes, small features):** Require approval from at least one Reviewer or Maintainer.
*   **Major Decisions (e.g., architectural changes, new features, release planning):** Require a majority vote (51%) of all active Maintainers.
*   **Release Voting:** A new release requires a majority vote (51%) of all active Maintainers. This includes agreement on the release content, version number, and timing.

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of a conflict within the project, the following steps will be taken:

1.  **Informal Discussion:** Parties involved will first attempt to resolve the conflict through direct communication and informal discussion.
2.  **Mediation by Reviewer:** If informal discussion fails, a neutral Reviewer will be asked to mediate the discussion and help find a resolution.
3.  **Maintainer Intervention:** If mediation by a Reviewer is unsuccessful, the conflict will be escalated to the Maintainers. The Maintainers will discuss the issue and propose a resolution.
4.  **Final Decision by Lead Maintainer:** In rare cases where Maintainers cannot reach a consensus, the Lead Maintainer (if designated) will make the final decision. If no Lead Maintainer is designated, a vote among Maintainers will determine the outcome.

All conflict resolution processes will be conducted with respect and a focus on the best interests of the project and its community. Violations of the Code of Conduct will be addressed by the Maintainers.
